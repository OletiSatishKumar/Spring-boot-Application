# 🚀 Spring Boot & React Full-Stack Application with CI/CD Pipeline ⚙️

Welcome to the **Spring Boot & React Full-Stack Application** repository! This project demonstrates a complete full-stack architecture, where the backend is powered by **Spring Boot** and the frontend by **React**, with a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** using **Jenkins**. Additionally, it leverages **Docker** for containerization and **SonarQube** for code quality analysis.

---

## 🗺️ Project Overview

This repository showcases a simple but powerful full-stack application built using the following stack:

- **Backend (Spring Boot)** ☕: Handles REST API requests, data processing, and database interactions.
- **Frontend (React)** ⚛️: Provides an interactive UI, making API calls to the backend.
- **CI/CD (Jenkins)** 🤖: Automates the build, test, quality analysis, Docker image creation, and deployment process.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Backend ☕:
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Maven**

### Frontend ⚛️:
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **npm**

### Database 🐬:
- **MySQL**: Stores and manages application data.

### CI/CD Pipeline 🤖:
- **Jenkins** (for pipeline automation)
- **SonarQube** (for code quality analysis)
- **Docker** 🐳 (for containerization)
- **Docker Compose** (for deployment)

### Version Control 🌳:
- **Git**

### Container Registry 🐳:
- **Docker Hub**

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Stages

The **Jenkins Pipeline** is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` and automates the following stages:

1. **Checkout Code ⬇️**: Clones the repository code.
2. **Verify Code Clone ✅/❌**: Ensures essential files (`pom.xml`, `src/index.js`) exist.
3. **Build Backend 🔨**: Compiles the Spring Boot backend using Maven.
4. **Code Quality - SonarQube 🧐**: Analyzes the backend and frontend code with SonarQube.
5. **SonarQube Quality Gate 🚦**: Waits for the quality gate to pass. The pipeline aborts if checks fail.
6. **Build Docker Images 🐳**: Creates Docker images for both backend and frontend.
7. **Push to Docker Hub 📤**: Pushes the Docker images to Docker Hub for deployment.
8. **Deploy with Docker Compose 🚀**: Deploys the app using Docker Compose.
9. **Post Actions 🧹**: 
    - **Always**: Cleans up the workspace.
    - **Success 🎉**: Prints a success message.
    - **Failure 🚨**: Prints an error message on failure.

## 🚀 How to Integrate & Run

To get this full-stack app up and running with CI/CD, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account** 🌐: Fork this repository to your own account.
- **Jenkins Server** 🤖: Ensure Jenkins is set up with the necessary plugins:
  - Pipeline
  - Git
  - Maven Integration
  - SonarQube Scanner
  - Docker
  - Docker Pipeline
  - Credentials Binding
- **SonarQube Server** 🧹: A running SonarQube server for code analysis.
- **Docker** 🐳: Docker installed on your Jenkins agents.
- **Docker Compose** 🐳: For multi-container deployment.
- **Docker Hub Account** 🐳: To push images.

### Integration Steps

1. **Fork the Repository** 🍴:
   - Go to the repository page and fork it to your GitHub account.

2. **Set Up Jenkins** ⚙️:
   - Install the required Jenkins plugins.
   - Configure your SonarQube integration and SonarQube Scanner tool.
   - Add Docker Hub credentials for pushing images.

3. **Create Jenkins Pipeline Job** ➕:
   - Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Set up the job to use the `Jenkinsfile` from the repository.

4. **Run the Pipeline** ▶️:
   - Trigger a build using the "Build Now" option in Jenkins.
   - Monitor the progress and logs.

5. **Deployment** 🚀:
   - Upon success, the pipeline will push Docker images to Docker Hub and deploy them using Docker Compose.

## 🔑 Important Considerations

- **`docker-compose.yml` 🐳**: Customize the `docker-compose.yml` file for your deployment needs, including ports, environment variables, etc.
- **SonarQube Keys** 🧐: Ensure that the `sonar.projectKey` values in `Jenkinsfile` match the SonarQube project keys.
- **Docker Hub Repository Names** 🐳: Replace `satishosk` with your Docker Hub username in the `Jenkinsfile`.
- **Jenkins Agent Configuration** ⚙️: Ensure the Jenkins agents have the required tools installed and configured (e.g., Maven, Docker).

---

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

- Ensure all Jenkins plugins are up-to-date.
- Verify Docker and Docker Compose configurations.
- Check if the SonarQube analysis is passing.

For any additional help, feel free to open an issue on the repository or consult the Jenkins, Docker, or SonarQube documentation.
